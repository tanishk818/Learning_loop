# LearningLoop: A platform for kids to understand programming in the form of game!!
## This main focus of our project is to get our users acquainted with code reading. After using our application users will have good practice on how a computer reads some code. It will be a useful skill when discovering code written by other people. It will be an essential skill while writing your own code too, having in mind how the computer will understand it, users will make less bugs, having been in the readerâ€™s position, users will care about writing clearer code, with meaningful naming and careful spacing. ##
